The webinar titled **"The Attention in Deep Learning Models"** was successfully held on Tuesday, June 11, 2024. This insightful event took place online and was accessible to a audience of researchers, practitioners, and students interested in the latest advancements in deep learning.

The webinar was divided into two main sections. The first part, led by [Prof. Maliheh Sabeti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Qn_ik_gAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), delved into the theoretical underpinnings of attention mechanisms in neural networks. Prof. Sabeti's session illuminated the concepts and mathematical foundations that enable these models to focus selectively on parts of the input data, enhancing their performance in complex tasks.

In the second part, [Engineer Armin Abdollahi](https://github.com/Armin-Abdollahi) took the stage to demonstrate the practical implementation of these theories. Through live coding sessions, Engineer Abdollahi showcased how attention mechanisms can be integrated into deep learning models, providing attendees with hands-on experience and code examples to apply in their own projects.

Together, the speakers provided a comprehensive overview of attention mechanisms, from theory to practice, highlighting their significance in improving the interpretability and efficiency of deep learning models across various applications such as translation, image recognition, and beyond.
